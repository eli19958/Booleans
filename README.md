Attached file has a coding that writes a function that takes two inputs and tells you if it is equal or not. 
Another problem that shows the code of is picking two numbers and the function tells you if it equal, or less than 10.
Also, the file attached shows an item list and tells you if that list has that number.

Lastly, in the attached file there is a function that checks wheather your game character has picked up all the items needed to perform certain tasks and check against any debuff.
